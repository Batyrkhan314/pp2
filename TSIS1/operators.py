#Python Arithmetic Operators
 

'''
+	Addition	x + y	
-	Subtraction	x - y
*	Multiplication	x * y	
/	Division	x / y	
%	Modulus	x % y	
**	Exponentiation	x ** y	
//	Floor division	x // y
Python Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:


=	x = 5	x = 5	
+=	x += 3	x = x + 3	
-=	x -= 3	x = x - 3
*=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
/=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
%=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
//=	x //= 3	x = x // 3	
**=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3	
&=	x &= 3	x = x & 
|=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	
^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
>>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
<<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3	
 

Python Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:


==	Equal	x == y	
!=	Not equal	x != y	
>	Greater than	x > y	
<	Less than	x < y
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y
Python Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

Operator	Description	Example	Try it
and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10	Try it »
or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4	Try it »
not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)	Try it »
Python Identity Operators
Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:

Operator	Description	Example	Try it
is 	Returns True if both variables are the same object	x is y	Try it »
is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y	Try it »
Python Membership Operators
Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:

Operator	Description	Example	Try it
in 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	x in y	Try it »
not in	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	x not in y	Try it »
Python Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:

Operator	Name	Description
& 	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
|	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
^	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~	NOT	Inverts all the bits
<<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
>>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
